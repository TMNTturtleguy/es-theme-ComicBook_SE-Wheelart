Theme 'ComicBook' vSE1.0 - 06-21-2017 by TMNTturtlguy
Controller.svg from "carbon" Eric Hettervik (Rookervik) RYOKAI.DEVIANTART.COM
Theme Concept based on images posted by: lipebello on Retropie.org.uk/forum
For use with EmulationStation (http://www.emulationstation.org/)

Special thanks to all who helped:
- modmaster - for helping create additional system backgrounds
- pjft - for all the support throughout the build, testing, and work on the pixel effect
- Nismo - for all of the testing, input, and suggested improvements
- Ruckage - for updating font characters to support multiple languages.

THIS IS A SPECIAL EDITION THAT SUPPORTS WHEELART - IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MARQUEE/WHEELART DO NOT USE THIS VERSION.

This theme is designed for 16:9 aspect ratio only.  It will work on small screens and is tested to work on up to 55" 4K HDTV with excelent quality
-it was noticed on some TV (LG HDTV) that the raspberry Pi picture is zoomed when the TV is set to 16:9.  Change the TV ratio to "list". All other Tv's work 16:9
-To be sure the theme is displayed correctly, there should be a gray border around all sides of the theme.

Thanks to new optimization and ES updates by @pjft there are no issues with performance.  VRAM should be set to 100.

See UserModInstruct.txt for instructions on available user modifications.

v2 is designed on EmulationStation with maxSize for video and carasoul updates.  It also works on the udpated Screensaver OMX build by @pjft on Apr2017
-Video and images will work properly on both VLC and OMX players. 
-If running on an older of ES without maxSize.  Edit line 78 of comic_book.xml to <size>.
-If running ES with carousel build, the games available should be in comic book font.  If not up to date, standard font will show.
